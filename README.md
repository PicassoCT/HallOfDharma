Kharma System for the Lobbys


This is a Codeblocks C project- and its a attempt to develop a self-moderating community system, as in- people will there fellow men, in order to not hang along with them. It was inspired by the ceaseless effort of google and the likes of them to shirk all social responsibilities of whatever hav(el)ock they unleash towards machinery. 
Is this good?
Is this evil?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide to escape from reality.
Open your eyes, look up to the Guiliotinne and see.
